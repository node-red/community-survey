# Node-RED User Experience Survey 2025

> Interactive dashboard presenting results from 600+ Node-RED users worldwide. Data is queryable via DuckDB WASM running entirely in the browser - no backend required.

This is a React-based data visualization application that uses client-side SQL via DuckDB WASM. The survey explores how the Node-RED community uses the platform, their challenges, and vision for the future of low-code programming.

## Data Model

The database file `node_red_survey.duckdb` contains survey responses in an EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) schema.

|--------|------|-------------|
| respondent_id | VARCHAR | Unique identifier for each survey respondent |
| question_id | VARCHAR | Short code identifying the survey question |

## Special Data Handling

### Country Data (GpGjoO)
Country codes are stored as **plain integers** (e.g., `840` for USA), NOT wrapped in JSON arrays like other single-select questions. The dashboard converts continent names to lists of country codes for filtering.

### Use Cases Abstraction (rO4YaX)
Raw responses are abstracted into 5 categories for filtering:
- Home/Personal
- Industrial/Business
- Data & Integration
- Education & Prototyping
- Specialized Applications

### Answer Format Types
- **Single-select**: Wrapped in JSON array: `["Selected Option"]`
- **Multi-select**: JSON array with multiple values: `["Option1", "Option2"]`
- **Ratings**: Plain integer strings: `"5"`
- **Country**: Plain integer (not in array): `840`
- **Free text**: Plain string
- **Matrix**: Nested JSON with sub-question UUIDs as keys

## Query Examples

### Count total respondents
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT respondent_id) as total_respondents
FROM survey.responses;
```

### Get experience level distribution
```sql
SELECT
    answer_text as experience_level,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM survey.responses
WHERE question_id = 'ElR6d2'
GROUP BY answer_text
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Find enterprise users (500+ employees) using Node-RED in production
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT r1.respondent_id
FROM survey.responses r1
JOIN survey.responses r2 ON r1.respondent_id = r2.respondent_id
WHERE r1.question_id = 'joRz61'
  AND r1.answer_text = '["500+ people"]'
  AND r2.question_id = 'ZO7eJB'
  AND r2.answer_text LIKE '%Yes%';
```

### Extract multi-select values (unnest JSON arrays)
```sql
SELECT
    respondent_id,
    TRIM(unnest(try_cast(answer_text AS JSON[]))::varchar, '"') as resource
FROM survey.responses
WHERE question_id = 'NXjPAO'
  AND answer_text != '[]';
```

### Calculate average rating for documentation
```sql
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(answer_text AS INTEGER)), 2) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(*) as responses
FROM survey.responses
WHERE question_id = 'QRZ4AX';
```

### Get ratings for users of a specific learning resource
```sql
-- Documentation rating for users who selected official documentation
SELECT
    AVG(CAST(r2.answer_text AS INTEGER)) as avg_rating,
    COUNT(*) as respondents
FROM survey.responses r1
JOIN survey.responses r2 ON r1.respondent_id = r2.respondent_id
WHERE r1.question_id = 'NXjPAO'
  AND r1.answer_text LIKE '%Official Website%'
  AND r2.question_id = 'QRZ4AX';
```

### Query qualitative themes
```sql
SELECT
    theme_name,
    description,
    json_array_length(respondent_ids) as respondent_count
FROM survey.qualitative_themes
WHERE question_id = 'gqlzqJ'
ORDER BY respondent_count DESC;
```

## Filter Categories

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: DuckDB WASM (runs in browser)
- **Charts**: Recharts

## Security Notes

All user-provided filter values are sanitized through dedicated utilities before being used in SQL queries. The application uses parameterized query building with proper escaping to prevent SQL injection.
